Overview

This project computationally generates Lewis dot structures for given molecular formulas. It uses Weighted Constraint Satisfaction Problems (WCSPs) to model chemical bonding rules and then 
solves them using Toulbar2, a constraint optimization solver. The goal is to automate the traditionally manual process of drawing Lewis structures, ensuring correct valence, bonding, and 
charge distribution for both covalent and ionic compounds.
